Measurements:
(Note 1: about pread type: large_pread means pread size equals to cache size; small_pread means pread size equals to block size 
(Note 2: fraction = fraction of data required)
(Note 3: elapsed time = time used in second)
(Note 4: pread count = number of pread function is called)
(Note 5: data count = total data read in GB)

For cache size = 5MB; block size = 4KB
